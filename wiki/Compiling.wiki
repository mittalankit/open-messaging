#summary Explains how to checkout and compile the source

= Introduction =

open-messaging is built using maven2, so all you need is a [http://maven.apache.org/ maven2] installation.


= Compiling =

There is currently one project
  * voicemail

If you would like to hack on open-messagin, you should build that project. Do the following:

{{{
mkdir workspace
cd workspace
svn co https://acoveo.com/svnroot/business/voicemail/trunk/voicemailple
cd voicemail
mvn eclipse:eclipse install
}}}

You can then import the project as an _existing project_ into eclipse. If you are using [http://eclipse.org/m2e/ m2eclipse], you can skip the _eclipse:eclipse_ goal and import the project as a _maven project_ instead.

= IMAP Server =

The platform requires a Dovecot IMAP server. See _src/test/resources/config_ for relevant configuration files.

= Asterisk =

The system requires a patched asterisk installation due to digium bugs. See _src/main/asterisk_patches_ for more information.
